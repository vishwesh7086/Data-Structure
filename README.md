# Data Structure Experiments in C

This repository contains a collection of basic data structure experiments written in the C programming language. Each experiment demonstrates a core concept commonly taught in computer science courses.

## ðŸ”¬ Experiments

| File Name                         | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| `experiment-1(marksaverage).c`   | Calculates the average of marks entered by the user using arrays. |
| `experiment-2(arrayoperations).c`| Performs basic array operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal. |
| `experiment-3(linkedlist).c`     | Implements a singly linked list with functions to insert, delete, and display nodes. |
| `experiment-4(stackoperations).c`| Demonstrates stack operations (push, pop, display) using arrays. |
| `experiment-5(insertionsort).c`  | Implements the insertion sort algorithm on an integer array. |
| `experiment-6(bfs).c`            | Performs Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal on a graph using an adjacency matrix and queue. |
