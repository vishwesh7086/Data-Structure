## ðŸ“‚ Files and Descriptions

| File Name         | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `arrayoperations.c` | Demonstrates basic array operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal. |
| `bfs.c`             | Implements **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm on a graph using adjacency matrix or list. |
| `insertionsort.c`   | Sorts an array using the **Insertion Sort** algorithm. |
| `linkedlist.c`      | Implements a **singly linked list** with operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal. |
| `marksaverage.c`    | Takes student marks as input and calculates the **average**. |
| `stack2.c`          | Implements a **stack** using arrays with push and pop operations. |
